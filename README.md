This is the source code for the Mod over Tabletop Simulator.
This has data for the meeples, as well as the source for the logic for the Calculator.
It accurately calculates the distance between models, from closest to closest points, and gives you 
the math for each weapon available.

The Repo works as a backup for the Steam mod as well as a showcase to non-players but code enthusiasts.
Any feedback is very much appreciated.
